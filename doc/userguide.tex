\chapter{Purpose and Goal}

\vonda is a framework to implement the dialogue management functionality in
dialogue systems. Although domain-independent, \vonda is tailored towards
dialogue systems with a focus on social communication, which implies the need
of a long-term memory and high user adaptivity. \vonda's specification and
memory layer relies upon (extended) RDF/OWL, which provides a universal and
uniform representation, and facilitates interoperability with external data
sources. The starting point for designing \vonda was the Information
State-Update approach to dialogue systems, which has a strong resemblance to
the Belief-Desire-Intention approach to Artificial Agents. Thus, it is not
surprising that \vonda can also serve as a base formalism for agent
functionality. A comparison of \vonda to other dialogue management systems and
other related information can also be found in \cite{kieferetal_vonda_2019}.

\vonda consists of three parts: A programming language tailored towards the
specification of reactive rules and transparent RDF data store usage, a
compiler that turns source code in this language into Java code, and a run-time
core which supports implementing dialogue management modules using the compiled
rules.

The framework is domain-independent. It was originally designed for multi-modal
human-robot interaction, but there is currently no specific functionality in
the core to either support the multi-modality nor the human-robot
interaction. The architecture (see figure \ref{fig:arch}) of the framework is
open and powerful enough to add these things easily.

At the base is an RDF store which implements the belief state and takes
incoming sensor and interaction data and stores it as RDF data. The data format
is backed by a data specification in the form of an ontology developed as part
of the dialogue manager, making the data (via the specification) available to
all other components.

The RDF store and reasoner of choice used in \vonda is HFC
\citep{krieger2013efficient}. For further details about the general
functionalities of HFC see chapter \ref{sec:hfc}. Section \ref{sec:example-hfc}
contains an example how HFC is used as database in a \vonda project.

The dialogue manager gets several inputs from various sources, the ones already
used are: input from automatic speech recognition (ASR) or typed natural
language input, user parameters, like name, age, hobbies, etc. but also more
dynamic ones like mood or health data, and also triggers from high-level
planning.

The second major component is the rule processor for the dialogue management
rules. When new data is added, a set of declaratively specified reactive rules
will propose dialogue moves or other actions and send these proposals to the
action selection mechanism. This mechanism selects the ``best'' of the proposed
actions and sends it back. If the proposed action results in dialogue acts,
these are turned into verbal output and gestures with the help of a multimodal
generation component, which retrieves parameters from the RDF database to adapt
the generation to the user's likings, and can also take into account sensor
data such as her or his estimated mood. The rules themselves can use all
available data, the incoming new data, but also the interaction history and
other data stored in the RDF database to make decisions.

The last major component contains the language interpretation module (not
explicitly shown in the picture), which turns spoken or written utterances into
dialogue acts, possibly with an intermediate step that involves a more
elaborate semantic format, and a multimodal generation component, which
converts outgoing dialogue acts into natural language utterances and gestures.

\chapter{Changes to \vonda Version 2}
\section*{Syntax changes (breaking changes)}
\begin{itemize}
\item the \texttt{import} keyword was replaced by
  \texttt{include}. \texttt{import} is now used exclusively like in
  Java, as class import definitions which are only allowed at the
  beginning of a rule file
\item the syntax of the type declaration for external classes has
  changed from
  \verb|[ SomeClass ]. myType Function ( argTypeA, argTypeB );| to
  \verb|# SomeClass myType Function (  argTypeA, argTypeB );|
\item \verb|{<exp>}| expansion syntax in field access

  In version 2, if one of the identifiers in a field access chain
  (like \texttt{child.name}) matched an existing variable of type
  string, the identifier was replaced with the value of the
  variable. This sometimes produced confusing results and unforeseen
  errors, and was too hard to grasp for novel users. Therefore, this
  has been replaced by the more visible approach also used for value
  expansion in the dialogue act specifications (see section
  \ref{sec:field_access_expansion}).
\item developing an unambiguous grammar for the java cast syntax
  \texttt{((Type)val)} is very hard. The current parser generator
  (bison) does not provide the functionality to get this right in all
  cases. Therefore, it has been replaced by an infix operato
  \texttt{isa}, so \texttt{((Type)val)} becomes \texttt{isa(Type,
    val)}.
\item the same holds for Java lambda1 expressions (\verb|c -> <expression>|). They were also replaced by infix syntax:
  \texttt{lambda(c) expression} resp. \texttt{lambda(c){ statements;
    }}
\end{itemize}
\section*{Configuration changes (breaking changes)}
\begin{itemize}
\item the formerly required extension of the run-time library
  \texttt{Agent} class is now optional. You can still do this, and
  specify the fully qualified name in the config file under
  \texttt{agentBase}, or the compiler will make the top-level rule
  class a subclass of \texttt{de.dfki.mlt.rudimant.agent.Agent}.
\item If you want to provide a file for type definitions to help the
  compiler, you have to specify it explicitely in the config under the
  key \texttt{typeDef}. In version 2, it was named after the now
  optional wrapper class, now it can take any name and is also optional
\end{itemize}
