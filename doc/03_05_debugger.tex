\section{Debugger/GUI}
\label{sec:debugger}

\vonda comes with a GUI \citep{rudibuggerThesis} that helps navigating, compiling and editing the source files belonging to a project. It can also be attached to your \vonda project at runtime to support debugging by logging the evaluation of rule conditions.
