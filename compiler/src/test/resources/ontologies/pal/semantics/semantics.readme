Semantics Ontology sem (Hans-Ulrich Krieger)

The "semantics" ontology is tailored to the specific needs of games, played in
PAL (quiz & sorting game).
For this, we deviate from the FrameNet Frame semantics (which would require heavy
modification & extension as it is very general) and developed a simple frame
semantics, oriented along _thematic roles_.
For this, we define a most general concept sem:Frame with the usual "suspects",
viz., properties sem:agent and sem:patient typed to sem:Actor, property sem:theme,
typed to sem:Entity (the superclass of Actor), and property sem:manner, typed to
sem:Manner.
Thus, these properties are all valid for subclasses of sem:Frames, as, for instance,
sem:Answering, sem:Asking, sem:BeingCorrect, sem:Continuing, or sem:Playing.
The subclass sem:AssigningRole defines a further property of its own, viz.,
sem:purpose, typed to sem:Frame.  Thus this property will allow us to represent
a role assignment to a specific participient; e.g., assigning the person who asks,
the person who plays, etc.
