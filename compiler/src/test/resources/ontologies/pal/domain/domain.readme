Domain Ontology dom (Hans-Ulrich Krieger)

The domain ontology represents knowledge about the PAL domain,
basically distinguishing between classes and subclasses dom:Actor
(e.g., dom:Child), dom:Medium (e.g., dom:Diary), Location (e.g.,
dom:Nursery), Disease (e.g., dom:Diabetes), etc.
The domain ontology also defines further XSD datatypes, such as
xsd:kg, xsd:cm, xsd:mmol_L, etc. for domain-specific properties,
such as dom:weight, dom:height, or, dom:bsl.

Version 0.9.4 addresses Rifca Peters JSON format of children
records, incl. super-property hasRelative, relating a child
to all its relatives.

Version 0.9.5 removes hasCaregiver in favor of isTreatedBy
(and inverse property treats), now generalizing domain to
Professional (with subtypes Caregiver and Doctor)
