DIT++ Dialogue Act Ontology dial (Hans-Ulrich Krieger)

The most sophisticated ontology integrates ideas from the DIT++ taxonomy
of dialogue acts (see http://dit.uvt.nl) and from the FrameNet lexical
database (see http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/).
Frames and dialogue acts are modelled independently from one another,
but dialogue acts incorporates frames through the property dafn:frame.
Dialogue acts also encode the succession of dialogue acts through
dafn:follows, define the dafn:sender, and the dafn:addressee, but also
allow a kind of embedding to model indirect speech in questions and
answers via property dafn:refersTo.
Modeling the shallow semantic arguments inside the frames frees us from
defining repeating properties on various dialogue acts over and over
again.


version v0.9.3 (21 Jan 2016) now separates the DIT taxonomy from
the definitions of the frames in two distinct ontologies.

version v0.9.4 (26 Jan 2016) adds parts of the Dimension Specific
Communicative Functions from DIT++ (notably, allo and auto feedback)
to the ontology; in addition, we abstract away from certain General
Purpose Functions through a new dimension called Aggregate Functions;
e.g., the aggregate class Accept subsumes AcceptOffer, AcceptRequest,
Agreement, CheckPositive, and Confirm.

version v0.9.5 (3 Jun 2016) adds further directives, such as dial:Advice
or dial:Urge, and introduces a subclass of dial:DomainRelatedFunction,
called dial:SocialFunction, with sublasses dial:Appeasement, dial:Praise,
and dial:Congratulation.
